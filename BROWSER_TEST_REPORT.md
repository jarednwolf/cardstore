## 💡 Employee Feedback

*"The application looks very professional and I can see it has all the features we need. However, I can't actually use any of the main functions right now. The design gives me confidence that this will be a great tool once the technical issues are resolved. The user interface is intuitive and I think our team will adapt to it quickly once it's working properly."*
