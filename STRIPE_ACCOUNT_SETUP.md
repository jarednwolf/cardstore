# 🚀 Stripe Account Setup - Get Your API Keys in 5 Minutes!

## Step 1: Create Stripe Account

1. **Go to [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)**
2. **Click "Start now" or "Sign up"** (not "Sign in")
3. **Fill out the form:**
   - Email address
   - Full name
   - Password
   - Country (United States)
   - Account type: Individual or Business

4. **Verify your email** (check your inbox)

## Step 2: Get Your API Keys (CRITICAL!)

Once logged in:

1. **Go to Dashboard → Developers → API Keys**
   - URL: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
   
2. **Copy these two keys:**
   ```
   Publishable key: pk_test_... (starts with pk_test_)
   Secret key: sk_test_... (starts with sk_test_) - Click "Reveal live key token"
   ```

3. **SAVE THESE KEYS** - You'll need them in the next step!

## Step 3: What to Do Next

Once you have your API keys:

1. **Come back to this terminal**
2. **Tell me your keys** and I'll:
   - Create the subscription products automatically
   - Configure the environment variables
   - Deploy to production
   - Test the payment flow

## 🎯 Quick Setup Tips

- **Use Test Mode** initially (keys start with `pk_test_` and `sk_test_`)
- **Business verification** can be done later
- **Bank account setup** can be done later
- **You can start accepting payments immediately** in test mode

## 🚨 Security Note

- **Never share your secret key publicly**
- **Only share it with me in this secure session**
- **I'll help you configure everything safely**
