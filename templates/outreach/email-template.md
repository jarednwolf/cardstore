Hi [Name],

âœ… Professional dashboard interface
âœ… Multi-location support

**Coming soon (free upgrades for beta customers):**
ðŸš€ Inventory management with TCG attributes
ðŸš€ Order processing and fulfillment
ðŸš€ Shopify integration
ðŸš€ Multi-channel selling (eBay, Amazon)

**Beta pricing: 50% off for early customers**
- Starter: $15/month (normally $30)
- Professional: $50/month (normally $100)
- Enterprise: $150/month (normally $300)

**14-day free trial, no credit card required**

Would you like a 5-minute demo this week? I can show you how it works with your current setup.

Best regards,
[Your name]

P.S. We're only accepting 50 beta customers, so spots are limited.
